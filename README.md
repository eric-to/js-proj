# Overview
Flappy bird with TensorFlow.js. Flappy Bird is a relatively simple game, but it'd be interesting to see if we could get a computer to play flappy bird (and learn how to get better).
MVPs
Day 1-2: Rebuild a simple flappy bird.
Day 2-3: Read up on TensorFlow.js.
Day 3-5: Create a neural network and train it overnight for 2 nights.
